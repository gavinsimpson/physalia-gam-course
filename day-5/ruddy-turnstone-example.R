# * `TideState` categorical, `High` or `Low` tide
# * `NumPecks` number of attempts by focal bird to capture a single prey item
# * `TimeOfDay` proportion of daylight period elapsed at time of observation
# * `TimeHighTide` time to the nearest high tide
# * `DaysStartWinter` number of days since November 1,
# * `Temperature` temperature in degrees celsius

# we have insignificant terms; what should we do? I would argue that from the
# point of view of inference, we should just leave the model as is. You (we)
# thought all these covariates had effects on the response, so we should control
# for them even if they turn out to be not statistically significant at some
# arbitrary threshold the community has decided to use. Importantly, note that
# excluding the insignificant terms would be tantamount to saying that the
# effect of these variables is === 0! Clearly the estimates *data* disagree with
# that!

# *if* you are interested in prediction, you could prune these out and refit,
# continuing to minimise some estimator of out-of-sample prediction error. You
# could compare models using Cross Validation or applied to a test set for
# example. Or you could use AIC.

# *if* you really aren't sure what should be in a model, then another
# alternative, but again, this comes from more of a prediction point of view
# rather than an inference or estimation point of view, you could use
# `select = TRUE`.

# of these options for predictions, I would probably use the shrinkage
# penalties (`select = TRUE`). That said, for prediction, and if you have a
# large enough data set, I would do repeated split sampling of the data into
# test and train sets, fitting with `select = TRUE` and compare which terms
# are in the models for each set of training data.

# Alternatively, I would only consider fitting separate models if there was
# strong a priori evidence or discussion suggesting two different hypotheses
# as to controls on the response and I wanted to test those hypotheses. In
# which case I would the models corresponding to the known hypotheses and
# compare their properties in terms of ability to replicate the data, predict
# new observations, etc.

# fit with extra shrinkage penalties
m1a <- update(m1, . ~ ., select = TRUE)

# compare the smooths of temperature
c_temp <- compare_smooths(m1, m1a, m3, select = "s(Temperature)")
draw(c_temp)

# As a scientist, would you treat these two estimated effects as different even
# though one of them was significant and one not at the threshold of 0.05?
