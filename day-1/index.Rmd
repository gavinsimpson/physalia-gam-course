# Generalized linear models

Generalised linear models (GLMs) are an extension of linear regression plus Poisson, logistic and other regression models

GLMs extend the types of data and error distributions that can be modelled beyond the Gaussian data of linear regression

With GLMs we can model count data, binary/presence absence data, and concentration data where the response variable is not continuous.

Such data have different mean-variance relationships and we would not expect errors to be Gaussian.

---

# Generalized linear models

Typical uses of GLMs in ecology are

- Poisson GLM for count data
- Logistic GLM for presence absence data
- Gamma GLM for non-negative or positive continuous data

GLMs can handle many problems that appear non-linear

Not necessary to transform data as this is handled as part of the GLM process

# Binomial distribution

* For a fixed number of trials (*n*),
* fixed probability of “success” (*p*), &
* two outcomes per trial (heads or tails)

Flip a coin 10 times with *p* = 0.7, the probability of 7 heads is $\sim Bin(n = 10, p = 0.7)$, ~ 0.27

```{r}
dbinom(x = 7, size = 10, prob = 0.7)
```

---

# Binomial distribution

```{r binomial-pdf, echo = FALSE}
## Binomial Probability mass function
s <- seq(0, 40, by = 1)
n <- rep(c(20,20,40), each = length(s))
binom.pmf <- data.frame(x = rep(s, 3),
                        n = rep(c(20,20,40), each = length(s)),
                        p = rep(c(0.5, 0.7, 0.5), each = length(s)))
binom.pmf <- transform(binom.pmf,
                       pmf = dbinom(x, size = n, prob = p),
                       params = paste("n=", n, "; p=", p, sep = ""))

plt.binom <- ggplot(binom.pmf, aes(x = x, y = pmf, colour = params)) +
    geom_point() + labs(y = "Probability Mass", x = "No. of Successes")
plt.binom
```

# Poisson distribution

The Poisson gives the distribution of the number of “things” (individuals, events, counts) in a given sampling interval/effort if each event is **independent**.

Has a single parameter $\lambda$ the average density or arrival rate

---

# Poisson distribution

```{r poisson-pdf, echo = FALSE}
s <- seq(0, 20, by = 1)
poisson.pmf <- data.frame(x = rep(s, 3),
                          lambda = rep(c(1,4,10), each = length(s)))
poisson.pmf <- transform(poisson.pmf,
                         pmf = dpois(x, lambda = lambda),
                         params = paste("lambda=", lambda, sep = ""))

plt.poisson <- ggplot(poisson.pmf, aes(x = x, y = pmf, colour = params)) +
    geom_point() + labs(y = "Probability Mass", x = "Count")
plt.poisson
```

# The structure of a GLM

A GLM consists of three components, chosen/specified by the user

.small[
1. A **Random component**, specifying the conditional distribution of of the response $y_i$ given the values of the explanatory data
2. A **Linear Predictor** $\eta$ &mdash; the linear function of regressors
    $$\eta_i = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{ik}$$
	The $x_{ij}$ are prescribed functions of the explanatory variables and can be transformed variables, dummy variables, polynomial terms, interactions etc.
3. A smooth and invertible **Link Function** $g(\cdot)$, which transforms the expectation of the response $\mu_i \equiv \mathbb{E}(y_i)$ to the linear predictor
    $$g(\mu_i) = \eta_i = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{ik}$$
    As $g(\cdot)$ is invertible, we can write
    $$\mu_i = g^{-1}(\eta_i) = g^{-1}(\alpha + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{ik})$$
]

# Conditional distribution of $y_i$

Originally GLMs were specified for error distribution functions belonging to the *exponential family* of probability distributions

- Continuous probability distributions
    - Gaussian (or normal distribution; used in linear regression)
	- Gamma (data with constant coefficient of variation)
	- Exponential (time to death, survival analysis)
	- Chi-square
	- Inverse-Gaussian
- Discrete probability distributions
    - Poisson (count data)
	- Binomial (0/1 data, counts from a total)
	- Multinomial

Choice depends on range of $y_i$ and on the relationship between the variance and the expectation of $y_i$ &mdash; *mean-variance relationship*

---

# Conditional distribution of $y_i$

Characteristics of common GLM probability distributions


|                  | Canonical Link | Range of $Y_i$               | Variance function              |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Gaussian         | Identity       | $(-\infty, +\infty)$         | $\phi$                         |
| Poisson          | Log            | $0,1,2,\ldots,\infty$        | $\mu_i$                        |
| Binomial         | Logit          | $\frac{0,1,\ldots,n_i}{n_i}$ | $\frac{\mu_i(1 - \mu_i)}{n_i}$ |
| Gamma            | Inverse        | $(0, \infty)$                | $\phi \mu_i^2$                 |
| Inverse-Gaussian | Inverse-square | $(0, \infty)$                | $\phi \mu_i^3$                 |


$\phi$ is the dispersion parameter; $\mu_i$ is the expectation of $y_i$. In the binomial family, $n_i$ is the number of trials

# Common probability distributions

Gaussian distribution is rarely adequate in ecology; GLMs offer ecologically meaningful alternatives

.small[
- **Poisson** &mdash; counts; integers, non-negative, variance increases with mean

- **Binomial** &mdash; observed proportions from a total; integers, non-negative, bounded at 0 and 1, variance largest at $\pi = 0.5$

- **Binomial** &mdash; presence absence data; discrete values, 0 and 1, models probability of success

- **Gamma** &mdash; concentrations; non-negative (strictly positive with log link) real values, variance increases with mean, many zero values and some high values

# Old notation

Wrote linear model as

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_j x_{ij} + \varepsilon_i$$

And assumed

$$ \varepsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2) $$

This doesn't work out the same for GLMs &mdash; we don't have residuals in the linear predictor

Sampling variation comes from the response distribution

---

# New notation

Rewrite linear model as

\begin{align*}
y_i & \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma^2) \\
\mu_i = \eta_i & = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_j x_{ij}
\end{align*}

This now matches the general form for the GLM

\begin{align*}
y_i & \sim \text{EF}(\mu_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
g(\mu_i) & = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_j x_{ij}
\end{align*}

# New notation

Binomial GLM

\begin{align*}
y_i & \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p_i) \\
\text{logit}(p_i) & = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_j x_{ij}
\end{align*}

Poisson GLM

\begin{align*}
y_i & \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\log(\lambda_i) & = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \cdots + \beta_j x_{ij}

# Logistic regression &mdash; *Darlingtonia*

Timed censuses at 42 randomly-chosen leaves of the cobra lily

.small[
* Recorded number of wasp visits at 10 of the 42 leaves
* Test hypothesis that the probability of visitation is related to leaf height
* Response is dichotomous variable (0/1)
* A suitable model is the logistic model
    $$\pi = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_i X}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i}}$$
* The logit transformation produces
    $$\log_e \left( \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$$
* This is the logistic regression and it is a special case of the GLM, with a binomial random component and the logit link function
]

---

# Logistic regression &mdash; *Darlingtonia*

$$\log_e \left( \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$$

.small[
* $\beta_0$ is a type of intercept; determines the probability of success ( $y_i = 1$ ) $\pi$ where X = 0
* If $\beta_0 = 0$ then $\pi = 0.5$
*  $\beta_1$ is similar to the slope and determines how steeply the fitted logistic curve rises to the maximum value of $\pi = 1$
* Together, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ specify the range of the $X$ variable over which most of the rise occurs and determine how quickly the probability rises from 0 to 1
* Estimate the model parameters using **Maximum Likelihood**; find parameter values that make the observed data most probable

* Differences in deviances are also known as ratios of likelihoods
* An alternative to the Wald tests are deviance ratio or likelihood ratio tests
    $$F = \frac{(D_a - D_b) / (\mathsf{df}_a - \mathsf{df}_b)}{D_b / \mathsf{df}_b}$$

# Biological control of diamondback moths

.small[
Uefune et al (2020) studied the use of synthetic herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to attract larval parasitoid wasps (*Cotesia vestalis*) to control diamondback moths (DBM: *Plutella xylostella*), a global pest of cruciferous vegetables, in greenhouses growing mizuna (Japanese mustard) in Japan.

They used two groups of greenhouses, the treated group having dispensers for the HIPVs as well as honeyfeeders to attract *C. vestalis* and a second untreated group. In each greenhouse, a single sticky trap, replaced weekly over 6 months, was used to catch both DBMs and *C. vestalis* and the numbers of both counted.

We will model numbers of *C. vestalis* against numbers of DBM and treatment using each trap as the units of analysis. The study was done in 2006 and 2008 but we only analyze the 2008 data.

While greenhouse ID could have been included as a random effect in a mixed model analysis, the available data did not record individual greenhouses.

How would you model the trend in these data?

# (Generalized) Linear Models

$$y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$

$$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathtt{year}_{i} + \beta_2 \mathtt{year}^2_{1i} + \cdots + \beta_j \mathtt{year}^j_{i}$$

Assumptions

1. linear effects of covariates are good approximation of the true effects
2. conditional on the values of covariates, $y_i | \mathbf{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$
3. this implies all observations have the same *variance*
4. $y_i | \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}$ are *independent*

An **additive** model addresses the first of these

# Polynomials perhaps&hellip;

We can keep on adding ever more powers of $\boldsymbol{x}$ to the model &mdash; model selection problem

**Runge phenomenon** &mdash; oscillations at the edges of an interval &mdash; means simply moving to higher-order polynomials doesn't always improve accuracy

GAMs are an intermediate-complexity model

* can learn from data without needing to be informed by the user
* remain interpretable because we can visualize the fitted features

# How is a GAM different?

$$\begin{align*}
y_i &\sim \mathcal{D}(\mu_i, \theta) \\ 
\mathbb{E}(y_i) &= \mu_i = g(\eta_i)^{-1}
\end{align*}$$

We model the mean of data as a sum of linear terms:

$$\eta_i = \beta_0 +\sum_j \color{red}{ \beta_j x_{ji}}$$

A GAM is a sum of _smooth functions_ or _smooths_

$$\eta_i = \beta_0 + \sum_j \color{red}{f_j(x_{ji})}$$
